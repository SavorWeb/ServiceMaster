									<h3>Water</h3>
									<p>Drying time on water losses is determined by a combination of factors, including the location, the duration and source of water, the types of building materials, the weather conditions, and how quickly emergency services begin. Through consistent monitoring and evaluation of the drying process, we can determine when the drying is complete. Your carpet may feel dry to the touch, but padding and sub-floors may still be wet underneath. While there are no rules to determine how long your property will take to dry, we can tell you, on average, it may take between three to five days or more, depending on the conditions.</p>

									<h3>Fire & Smoke</h3>
									<p>There are many variables and many services involved in fire and smoke restoration, it is difficult to predict exactly how long the complete restoration of your home or businessÂ will take. Your Project Manager should go over the scope and expected schedule of events for your project with you once they have completed the initial inspection. </p>

											If you file an insurance claim, we recommend discussing this with your insurance adjuster. However, this is a decision you must reach on your own. Here are some things to consider; safety concerns, odors, electricity, and noise from equipment.

										<p>
											Noise is the number one complaint we receive from property owners that stay on site during restoration. Air movers and dehumidifiers will create a lot of noise and make your property drafty for the days they are onsite. It is important equipment remains on, so if the noise is disruptive to you, you might want to consider an alternate place to stay.

We at SMNI understand this and will do our very best to make this trying time as bearable as possible.

								<div id="c2-2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
									<div class="panel-body">
										<p>
											When water damage has occurred, water can be absorbed into the drywall, baseboards, sub-flooring, etc. Drying these surfaces requires high-velocity air movers to accelerate the release of absorbed water into the air. Dehumidifiers are necessary for removing this excess moisture to help protect property and create conditions for efficient drying.

									</h4>
								</div>
								<div id="c2-3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
									<div class="panel-body">
										<p>
											The process of drying water-damaged homes involves the use of proper evaporation rates along with equivalent dehumidification to remove moisture from the air. SMNI monitors this process by reviewing the relationship of relative humidity and temperature. This relationship is called psychometrics. Regular household dehumidifiers are made to maintain humidity levels and are not capable of keeping up with the massive amount of humidity caused by water damage. Trying to dry your home out yourself can actually make the situation worse.

									<div class="panel-body">
										<p>
											It is not unusual to smell odors during the drying process. Increased heat and humidity can also lead to increased odors that may be coming from the drying building materials, or dormant spills or accident areas. Do not confuse these normal odors with the odor of mold. As the drying continues and humidity levels drop, you will notice these odors disappearing on their own. Deodorizers can be used to minimize these effects as well. If the odors are bothersome or you are concerned, please address this with your SMNI technician.

											Wood flooring must be evaluated during the drying process.

If you filed a claim, your insurance adjuster will work with you to make the final decision as to whether the floors will need to be refinished or replaced.
